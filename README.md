# Intro

The purpose of this program is to apply the acquired knowledge of Lexical and Syntax Analysis. The program applies
these principles on a supplied string on some predefined grammar. The result is the
complete SLR (1) parsing procedure up to the point where the string is either
accepted or rejected by the parser.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

## Details

- The first module of this program is the lexical analyzer (tokenizer).
- The second phase of the compiler is the Syntax Analysis phase.
